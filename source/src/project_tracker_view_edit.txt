This is a temp file with the full editable table implementation that I'll need to add. Due to the size and complexity, I'll apply it in multiple steps.

Key changes needed:
1. Change DrawItemsTable signature to take non-const reference
2. Add status options array
3. Replace ImGui::Text calls with ImGui::BeginCombo for dropdowns
4. Add ImGui::InputText for editable text fields
5. Track metadata changes and save to database via m_subscriptionManager
